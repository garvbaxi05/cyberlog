Overview

This Flutter project displays a simple Home Screen dashboard using two styled cards.
It demonstrates basic UI layout, widget styling, and structuring using Flutter’s core widgets.

Features Implemented
1. MaterialApp + HomeScreen Setup

The app starts with a MaterialApp wrapped inside the MyApp widget.
HomeScreen is set as the default landing page, and the debug banner is disabled.

2. AppBar

The screen includes a standard AppBar with the title "Home", following Material Design guidelines.

3. Dashboard Layout (Column + Containers)

The dashboard section is built using:

A Column to stack elements vertically
