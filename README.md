JIT vs AOT Compilation

JIT (Just-In-Time) compiles code during runtime, enabling fast development features like hot reload.
AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) compiles the app into optimized machine code before execution, giving faster startup and better performance for release builds.

How Conditionals Were Used

The app reads the number entered by the user and uses an if-else statement to check:

If number % 2 == 0, it is Even

Otherwise, it is Odd

This demonstrates Dart’s basic conditional flow.

How String Interpolation Was Used

The final message shown on the screen uses Dart's string interpolation:
"The number $value is Even."
It lets variables be placed directly inside strings in a clean and readable way.
